# Overview

As a software engineer in training, my goal is to deepen my understanding of JavaScript and develop a strong foundation in designing interactive web applications. This project is a Memory Game, created to demonstrate my ability to work with JavaScript's core features, including ES6 syntax, DOM manipulation, recursion, and integration with external libraries. The Memory Game challenges players to match pairs of cards while enjoying a visually engaging and interactive experience.

This software was designed to showcase JavaScript's versatility in creating dynamic and responsive applications. Through this project, I aimed to strengthen my knowledge of game logic, animations, and debugging techniques. It also provided an opportunity to practice using external libraries for enhanced functionality and aesthetics.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

For this project, I used the following tools and technologies:

- Code Editor: Visual Studio Code
- Browser: Google Chrome (for testing and debugging)
- Programming Language: JavaScript (ES6+)
- External Libraries: Anime.js for animations
- Version Control: Git and GitHub for managing project versions and deployment

# Useful Websites

- MDN Web Docs - JavaScript: Comprehensive documentation on JavaScript features and syntax.
- Anime.js Documentation: Reference for implementing smooth animations.
- W3Schools - JavaScript DOM: Guide for DOM manipulation.
- Stack Overflow: Helpful for troubleshooting specific implementation challenges.

# Future Work

To further enhance this project, I plan to:

- Add multiple difficulty levels with varying grid sizes.
- Implement a timer to create a time-based challenge.
- Allow users to select different themes (e.g., animals, numbers, or emojis).
- Introduce a leaderboard to track high scores.
- Optimize the code for better performance and readability.
- This project was a rewarding way to explore JavaScript's capabilities, and I look forward to expanding its features and applying these skills to future projects.
